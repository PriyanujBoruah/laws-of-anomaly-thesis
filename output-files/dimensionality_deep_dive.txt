--- Dimensionality Deep Dive: Binned Analysis (Corrected) ---
======================================================================
A positive value means Ensembles performed better.
A negative value means Linear Models performed better.

Dimensionality_Bin  Delta_Ensemble_vs_Linear
Low (Tall Datasets)                0.111692
Medium (Balanced Datasets)         0.047205
High (Wide Datasets)               0.065595

--- Interpretation ---
- Finding: There is no clear, monotonic trend. The performance gap between Ensembles and Linear Models does not consistently increase or decrease with dimensionality.
